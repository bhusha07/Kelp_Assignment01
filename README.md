CSV_TO_JSON  Convertor

I have Implemented the CSV to JSON convertor API in node Application (express js) . The Api take the path of csv file from env config and convert it into JSON format.
The JSON data is then interprated like name ,age ,adress ,additional_info  out if which name and age are mandatory fields. This data is then sent to the Mysql Database in post request .
After data is successfully added to db it calculate the percentage age-wise distribution of all the users and print it on console.

Steps to follow:
1)Give path of CSV file in env congfig
2)add node modules
3)Change database credentails from env config 
3)run the node application 


NOTE:
1)I have used mysql database instead of postgres

Thank you so much!!
